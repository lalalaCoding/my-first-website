    The government is expected to accept Indonesia's proposal to pay only 600 billion won out of 1.6 trillion won in joint development contributions for the KF-21 fighter jet program. This is to minimize the negative impact on the development of the KF-21 while promoting defense exports.

“At the end of March, the Indonesian Defense Ministry proposed a plan to pay some 100 billion won every year for three years from this year to 2026,” Noh Ji-man, director general of the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA)’s KF-X Program Group, said in a press briefing on May 8. “Timely development of the KF-21 is our top priority, and we are considering accepting it in the national interest.”

    Former U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that South Korea is “paying virtually nothing for the 40,000 U.S. troops in South Korea.” In an interview with Time magazine last week, he also said that South Korea was supposed to pay “billions of dollars” during his presidency, but it “has been paying almost nothing through renegotiations” after Joe Biden took office. The remarks were also criticized as inaccurate by the U.S. media. The number of U.S. troops in South Korea during Trump's tenure was between 26,878 and 29,389, and South Korea increased its contribution by 13.9 percent after Biden took power. In 2023, South Korea paid a record $1.29 trillion. It is regrettable that Trump, who had received detailed reports on the occasion of his visit to the U.S. military base in Pyeongtaek in November 2017, made the ally uncomfortable with such factually incorrect remarks.
